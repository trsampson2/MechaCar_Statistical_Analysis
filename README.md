Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Vehicle length and ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.  Vehicle length has a p-vlaue of 2.6e-12 and ground clearance has a p-value of 5.21e-08.  The other variables have p-values ocer the signifcance level of 0.05. 

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope is not considered to be zero because at least one of the variables are non-random.  There is signficant evidence to reject the null hypothesis.


Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
